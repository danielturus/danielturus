I'm passionate about:

- solving problems (I really love when systems run optimally - or as good as possible)
- (playing) table tennis
- PC hardware components
- clean designs

Favorite quotes:

- Standing on the shoulders of giants. [↗️ url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants)
- Focus on the goals not the means.
- If you wait for inspiration you'll never get anything done.
- And you know what’s interesting, you know who the best managers are? They’re the great individual contributors, who never ever want to be a manager, but decide they have to be a manager because no one else is going to be able to do as good a job as them. [src](https://youtu.be/rQKis2Cfpeo?t=130)
- The greatest people are self-managing. They don’t need to be managed. Once they know what to do, they’ll go figure out how to do it and they don’t need to be managed at all. What they need is a common vision, and that’s what leadership is. What leadership is having a vision, being able to articulate that so the people around you can understand it, and getting a consensus on a common vision. [src](https://youtu.be/rQKis2Cfpeo)
- You can be mad at the rain, but it will continue to fall
- You can easily judge the character of a man by how he treats those who can do nothing for him.

Some of my coding principles:

- Code that is easy to read is easy to maintain.
- Code is read way often than it is written, focus on the reader when writing code.
- When reading code, most of the times we're not actually _*reading*_ but _scanning_ and after scanning is done we're starting to read. Organize code so that it is easily to be scanned.
- Try to solve a problem by not introducing another problem.
- Write code that you'll be somehow confident that your future self or future devs will understand. In this way (hopefully) you'll have less "WTF is going on here?!" moments.
