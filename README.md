Favorite quotes:
* Standing on the shoulders of giants. [↗️ url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants)
* Focus on the goals not the means.

Some of my coding principles:
* Code that is easy to read is easy to maintain.
* Code is read way often than it is written, focus on the reader when writing code.
* When reading code, most of the times we're not actually _*reading*_ but _scanning_ and after scanning is done we're starting to read. Organize code so that it is easily to be scanned.
* Try to solve a problem by not introducing another problem.
* Write code that you'll be somehow confident that your future self or future devs will understand.
