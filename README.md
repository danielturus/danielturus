### Hi there 👋

My name is Daniel Turuș and I am a Full Stack JavaScript developer with over 5 years of experience.

🌱 I’m always open to learning new stuff

I'm passionate about:
* solving problems (I really love when systems run optimally - or as good as possible)
* (playing) table tennis
* PC hardware components
* clean designs

Favorite quotes:
* Standing on the shoulders of giants. [↗️ url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants)
* Focus on the goals not the means.
* If you wait for inspiration you'll never get anything done.
* And you know what’s interesting, you know who the best managers are? They’re the great individual contributors, who never ever want to be a manager, but decide they have to be a manager because no one else is going to be able to do as good a job as them.

Some of my coding principles:
* Code that is easy to read is easy to maintain.
* Code is read way often than it is written, focus on the reader when writing code.
* When reading code, most of the times we're not actually _*reading*_ but _scanning_ and after scanning is done we're starting to read. Organize code so that it is easily to be scanned.
* Try to solve a problem by not introducing another problem.
* Write code that you'll be somehow confident that your future self or future devs will understand. In this way (hopefully) you'll have less "WTF is going on here?!" moments.
